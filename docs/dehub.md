DeHub: A Decentralised, User Owned Alternative To Legacy Media Apps.
Resist censorship & live forever onchain.
Imagine a world where creators own their audience data, control their content distribution, and never fear censorship or demonetization. DeHub makes this a reality as a decentralised and user owned alternative to apps such as YouTube, X, Rumble, Twitch and Patreon. Powered by its own utility token and cutting-edge DePIN infrastructure that's reshaping how content is hosted, transcoded, and delivered globally.
Built by gamers & streamers, we've solved the crypto complexity problem. Our platform delivers a seamless Web2 experience while everything runs on-chain with full transparency—no wallet setup, no gas fees, no technical barriers. Just pure creative freedom with blockchain-verified earnings visible on our public leaderboards.
Launch PPV events, monetise with subscriptions or paid messages, create Watch2Earn experiences to grow an audience or reward existing communities, or distribute exclusive token-gated content—all without traditional banking or KYC processes. Your content, your rules, your revenue. Direct creator-to-fan relationships in a censorship-resistant ecosystem where your success is entirely in your hands.
Join millions of creators already building the user-owned economy of tomorrow across decentralised apps, where value flows directly to those who create it—completely free from corporate gatekeepers and algorithmic manipulation.
Our journey began as Futurov (FTV), where we built a thriving community of streamers and gamers who loved our Web2 app and gave us incredible reviews on Google Play Store. Now we're taking everything they loved and making it unstoppable.

Important Notice
DeHub tokens serve as utility tokens within our ecosystem, similar to in-game currencies, and are not investment vehicles. While our blockchain infrastructure provides unprecedented transparency and verifiable on-chain data for educational purposes, all markets carry inherent risks. You could lose your entire investment due to market volatility, technical issues, security breaches, or unforeseen circumstances. Only participate with funds you can afford to lose completely. DeHub and its affiliates assume no responsibility for any financial losses incurred.
A Complete Ecosystem
As a social & streaming app, there is only a certain level of censorship resistance that would be deemed acceptable, given the illegal and immoral content that could be uploaded.
Therefore, we have built an articulate on-chain protocol with decentralised moderation mining as well as instant 2 click watch-to-earn, content locking or PPVs for any token. Every upload automatically mints an NFT stored on IPFS while A.I remove unlawful content and directs adult content to a dedicated 18+ zone.
Our d'app is unique as it empowers creators by enabling full ownership of subscriber data. You can now take your business anywhere you want and reach your audiences no matter what.


Sign up with socials or email and have a wallet generated for you in a few clicks. No private key management or custody, you are in full control of your assets and we never access your funds.
Given that data is the new oil, it may be wise to build your core community base here and utilise your existing social media apps to funnel users in to grow your own valuable database and ensure you remain censorship resistant. No matter what happens, never lose touch with your audience, fans, community or customers.
Upload
On the above user upload dashboard, notice how simple it is for anyone to instantly upload content and in a few clicks enable the following:
Watch2earn: every token now has sustainable watch2earn utility at the click of a button
Token gated content: stream or upload content locked behind any token contract viewers must hold
PPV events: charge any token for a pay-per-view or live stream
NFT collectables: every post mints an NFT that earns the lifetime royalty attached to the video
Earn: DeHub tokens via tips through supporters and rise up on the leaderboards for larger shares of ad revenue
Subscribers: Upload or stream content exclusively for your subscribers
Tokenised Content & Fractionalised Ownership
Revolutionary ERC-1155 Content Tokenisation
Every upload and livestream on DeHub automatically mints an ERC-1155 NFT fractionalised into exactly 1,000 pieces. Creators have complete control over how many fractions to sell or keep, creating a novel monetisation model where fans can invest in content they believe will succeed - essentially "betting" on the future of potential stars through a revolutionary form of fan tokens.
Automatic Fractionalisation
• Every upload/stream mints ERC-1155 NFT
• Automatically split into 1,000 fractions
• Instant tokenisation on content creation
• No additional setup required
• Seamless blockchain integration
Creator Control
• Choose how many fractions to sell
• Retain control over distribution
• Set custom pricing strategies
• Decide release timing
• Maintain creative ownership
Eternal Revenue
• Content earns ad revenue for life
• Permissionless residual income
• Censorship-resistant earnings
• No ongoing value creation required
• Passive income for all eternity
Revolutionary Fan Investment Model
Betting on Future Stars
DeHub creates the first platform where fans can financially invest in creators they believe will become successful. By purchasing fractions of content NFTs, supporters become stakeholders in a creator's journey, earning returns when their chosen creators achieve success through ad revenue, tips, and other monetisation streams.
How Fractionalisation Works
1. Automatic Minting
Every piece of content instantly becomes an ERC-1155 NFT split into exactly 1,000 tradeable fractions.
2. Creator Decision
Creators choose how many of their 1,000 fractions to sell, keep, or distribute to their community.
3. Fan Investment
Supporters purchase fractions, becoming stakeholders who earn proportional returns from all revenue streams.
Benefits for All Parties
For Creators
Instant monetisation, community funding, aligned incentives, and lifetime passive income from successful content.
For Fans
Financial upside from supporting rising stars, tradeable assets, and direct participation in creator success.
For Everyone
Censorship-resistant, permissionless system that creates value for all participants without platform dependency.
SocialFi Platform Comparison
The Key Difference: Residual vs. Active Value Creation
Unlike other SocialFi platforms where creators must continuously add value for their tokens, shares, or keys to maintain worth, DeHub content generates residual income for life. Once created, content earns ad revenue permanently - providing passive, permissionless, censorship-resistant income for all eternity without requiring ongoing creator effort.

The Future of Content Economics

Explore The App & Beyond
Search bars aggregate YouTube and other major streaming app APIs to save you juggling multiple apps, while the explore page also houses our live community chat and dedicated leaderboards for:
Most views (MV)
Most subscribers (MS)
Biggest earners (BE)
Biggest spenders (BS)
That together will determine ad revenue share (RS). The exact algorithm to this is under beta and subject to change depending on revenue generated (RG)
MV + MS + BE + BS = (RG / RS)
This is the core algorithm, and experimentations in rewards will continue on a trial and error basis until the perfect equilibrium is found.

Mine Through Content Moderation
Decentralised moderation mining and revenue share model
Only a few wallets hold over 50m $DHB tokens, of which most are operational wallets, with the remaining being known community members.
Only the core team or top tier badge holders will have the power to instantly remove a video by burning the NFT associated. Subsequently, all the ad revenue generated and any play to earn bounties strapped to the video will be shared with all voting wallets to further deter bad actors and incentivise an engaged community.
The Amount of $DHB required for all utility is a dynamic variable, so must be subject to be changed at any time in relation to price. Any changes will be announced publicly on all official channels.
Governance + Moderation System Design
Our comprehensive governance and moderation system creates a fair, transparent, and community-driven platform that prevents centralized censorship while maintaining quality standards through economic incentives and advanced mechanisms.
Token Utility Design
By default, our native governance token $DHB enables the following roles:
Moderation staking
Voting on content disputes and platform rules
Curation and promotion of content
Key Principle: More tokens = more influence, but influence ≠ unchecked power.
Quadratic Voting
To reduce whale dominance:
We use quadratic voting for key moderation decisions.
Example: Voting power = √(tokens staked)
So, staking 100 tokens = 10 votes, 10,000 tokens = 100 votes (not 10,000 votes).
Moderation Staking Pools
Users can stake tokens to become moderators.
Each flagged piece of content enters a moderation queue.
Stakers vote on the outcome (ban, warn, ignore, etc).
Correct votes (as per final outcome) earn rewards; wrong votes may result in slashing.
Incentive: Stake = skin in the game. Higher-quality moderation = higher rewards.
Delegated Moderation (for scaling)
Users can delegate their votes to trusted curators or moderation pools (think: staking to a validator in PoS).
Curators/moderators can be swapped anytime.
This allows passive users to participate in governance while rewarding active ones.
Content Tiering via Curation Markets
Users stake tokens to "curate" or promote content.
The market decides what rises (token-weighted attention), not an algorithm.
If bad content is boosted and flagged, curators may be slashed.
DAO-Based Appeals
Content creators can appeal moderation decisions via DAO proposals.
Token holders vote (again with quadratic logic).
Helps prevent abuse by moderation cartels or brigading.
Progressive Access Control
Instead of "1 token = 1 power", implement progressive caps:
Your influence decays beyond certain staking thresholds.
Encourages wider distribution of token holdings.
Could use sigmoid functions or bonding curves.
Incentive Flywheel
Watchers earn token rewards for passive viewing (engagement mining).
Curators earn more if their promoted content performs well.
Moderators earn based on accuracy, rewarding good behaviour
Governance participants (voters on proposals) get small boosts for activity.
This creates a circular economy that drives participation & incentivises good beh
 Anti-Manipulation Measures
Sybil resistance: Require staking + reputation for key votes.
Multi-signature council fallback: In case of DAO malfunction (only for emergencies).
Transparent moderation history: Every decision logged on-chain.

8,000,000,000
Burn at LGE
3,360,000,000
Circulating Supply at last LGE
2,154,403,105
Final Supply
1,000,000,000
Burn & Tax Schedule
Burn Schedule
42% on launch. Then periodic and dynamic down to final supply
Seed or Private Unlocks
0 on launch as no VCs were involved in building DeHub
Dilution/Emission Schedule
Net negative - operational & team wallets are not permitted to liquidate any tokens past rewards and should never go below original balance barring un-staking fees. In theory, we are already at a fully diluted valuation (FDV).
Sales
100% of liquidity raised was locked into pools for traders. No pre sale events or investment where raised to fund development and DeHub launched as FTV with a fully built app on the google play store prior to any token release or fundraise. Only liquidity generation events (LGE) on behalf of the community to facilitate trading occurred. BNB, therefore DeHub can only be acquired via KYCd wallets meaning we did not need extra layers for our own sales.
Allocations
Team Allocation
8% of the total supply is reserved for DeHub contributors. No team wallet can sell below their percentage allocation and only rewards are tradable.
Operational Allocation
8% of the total supply is allocated for:
Operations & Awareness Raising
Research & Development
Partnerships & Licensing
No operational wallet can sell below their percentage allocation and only the rewards are tradable. This in theory means the supply will never dilute beyond its current point and it's safe to assume we are at fully diluted valuation. This also technically means that there was no premine as none can be sold. No funds where raised to build the protocol which was already in beta prior to a token release.
Burn Wallet
42% of the supply will be burnt on launch to ensure the burn wallet accumulates rewards or airdrops holders are entitled for further reducing the supply automatically. All profits are used to buy back $DHB. This is 100% distributed to stakeholders and the burn wallet in proportion to holdings.

DeHub Token
Tokens are used for subscribing to creators, tipping streamers or unlocking content. The more you hold, the lower your fees are and the more superpowers you unlock like timeline trend boosts and verification badges.
Instant Payments
Using stripe, you can buy tokens instantly and seamlessly into whatever account you're logged into. DeHub makes tokens simple and for all. If you need more support, just pop up in our 24/7 live community chat and ask for admin support.
Secure Gateway
All payment details are encrypted and processed securely by Stripe, we can't access or store your sensitive information or card details giving you ultimate peace of mind.
Disclaimer
DeHub tokens are strictly for utility purposes in the same way that any in-game or in-app digital tokens or currencies and strictly not an investment. As our token lives on-chain, we can offer added utility as well as unprecedented levels of verifiable transparency. The above data is solely compiled for transparency, educational and informative purposes only. DeHub and all affiliates hold no liability for financial losses incurred from purchasing any tokens or NFTs we release. Markets are highly volatile. You could also lose all your money due to any unforeseen errors such as competency failures, technical error, hacks and so on. Therefore, you should only ever spend what you can afford to lose.
Governance
Fixing token governance with a novel solution
Fair Voting Logic
DeHub is introducing a fairer voting logic where by stakeholder weight is multiplied by limited amounts ensuring no single entity can control the protocol while larger investors are still rewarded proportionally. We have also incorporated new game theory whereby each vote requires the voter to burn X amount of $DHB, currently set at 50. This further disincentives bad actors or manipulation while incentivising engagement which should enourage more users to vote on each poll.
Preventing Whale Manipulation
Our novel voting logic ensures no single entity can control the protocol while still rewarding larger investors proportionally.
Encouraging Engagement
The burn requirement for voting incentivizes meaningful participation and discourages frivolous or malicious voting.
Solving Governance Issues
Currently, the two most notorious reasons for token governance's poor reputation is whale manipulation & lack of engagement from the wider holder base. The above voting logic and game theory offers a novel solution to these globally recognised issues and we hope to prove the token governance skeptics wrong.
DeHub's governance protocol is set to launch officially in early 2026.
Stay tuned for more...

Stake
Stake Now : https://dehub.net/staking
Stake to access different club tiers the enhanced features across all d'apps and provide your computing power or storage space from with little as a mobile to mine your share of protocol revenue.
As further allocations will now be dynamic, dependant on protocol fees, designations will be subject to requirements at any given moment ensuring the protocol needs are at the forefront at all times. The staking protocol is also being upgraded currently with release on Base soon.
Technicals
Joining clubs also unlocks the below badges that are displayed on your dehub.io profile, comments, uploads and live chat communications.
Beyond the perks for the amount of $DHB staked, there are also three pre-defined tiers determined by stake duration which define user rewards.
Tier 125% Rewards
Stake 1 to 2 quarters, and share 25% of rewards
Tier 225% Rewards
Stake 3 to 4 quarters, and share 25% of rewards
Tier 350% Rewards
Stake 5+ quarters, and share 50% of rewards
Staking User Flow
• Users stake $DHB tokens in staking pool, and choose one of 3 tiers to stake in a reward period. Users can't stake multiple tiers in the same reward period.
• Users can see their current shares on the tier which they have chosen to stake and total unlocked amount, as well as the token unlock date.
• Prior to the unlock date, the users can unstake only 88% of their staked tokens. Once they reach the unlock date, they can choose to unstake or restake free of fees.
• When users unstake, they receive back their original $DHB token allocation.
• Users can automatically restake or manually restake. Restaking starts from the time users confirm the `Restake` button. When restaking, users can change their original tier.
• DeHub team funds reward anytime, users get reward immediately.
• Users can claim their rewards anytime without unstaking if they have any to.
• Users can increase their staked amount in the current reward period, but this is only available for Tier 3 stakers.
Reward Calculation
DeHub team funds reward at variable times dependant on protocol fees, with announcements to the community.
Users might get rewards immediately from staking, or they might have to wait for injections depending on when they staked.
Calculation Formula:
Locking percent = 100% * (Now - Staking start time) / Staking period
Staking amount = Current locked amount * Locking percent
Staking share of user = 100% * Staking amount
Rewards = Staking share * Funded rewards * Tier percent
Example:
User A, B, C stakes 1000 $DHB tokens on different tiers. Reward 1, 2, 3 indicates the times that 5000 $DHB tokens were injected as rewards by the DeHub team.
• User A staked on Tier 1 for 1 quarter
• User B staked on Tier 2 for 3 quarters after first rewarding
• User C staked on Tier 3 for 5 quarters after first rewarding
Restake Rules
Users can choose either automatic or manual restaking, during harvest. For automatic restaking, simply click the restake button and watch as the magic unfolds on chain. For the manual process, simply unstake, play about with your metamask for a while then follow the original staking process.
Important Notes:
• Restaking means unstake all the unlocked/locked tokens and stake again
• Users can use the automatic restake button before they reach the unlock date yet this comes at a 12% fee, outside of harvest dates
• When automatically restake, users can change locking period
• If users force to restake locked tokens manually, only 88% of total amount will stake in the pool and 12% will be transferred to the dev wallet
How to Stake
The steps are very simple and consist of minimal clicks or technical requirements.
1
Connect Wallet
2
Click "Stake" Button
3
Input Amount & Duration
4
Confirm Transaction
Note: during the first transaction you will have to approve the staking contract first. This will happen only once.
How Staking Rewards are Generated
Staking rewards are generated from all fees taken by the network's streams of revenue as well as a base allocation from initial injection.
Fee Sources:
• Fees from in app services like subscriptions, PPV, Watch2Earn, paid DMs and more.
• DeHub premium: ad free usage & access to AI toolkits via monthly / annual fees.
• Token & NFT primary sales & secondary trading fees.
• Advertising across video, lives & scroll feeds.
• Partner launches and airdrops.

DePIN
A Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) of Shared Computing Power For True Censorship Resistance
Abstract
This whitepaper introduces a Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) designed to scale and sustain DeHub. The system leverages shared computing power from a network of miners who contribute resources for data hosting, transcoding, and delivery. Miners are rewarded directly from application revenue and token transaction fees, ensuring a sustainable, inflation-free model. This paper outlines the technical framework, economic incentives, and implementation strategies for deploying this DePIN, enabling contributions from as little as a mobile device.

Introduction
Challenges in Streaming and Gaming Platforms
Centralised infrastructure for streaming and gaming platforms faces challenges such as high operational costs, scalability limits, and susceptibility to censorship or outages. These challenges hinder the ability of platforms like DeHub to achieve its purpose of being a decentralised, permissionless and user owned protocol that lives forever on-chain while maintaining cost efficiency.
Solution: Shared Computing DePIN
By decentralising the infrastructure, DeHub can tap into a distributed network of computing power to address these challenges. A DePIN allows users to share their computing resources, ensuring:
Cost Efficiency: Lower hosting and delivery costs by using shared resources.
Scalability: Dynamically grow the network as demand increases.
Sustainability: Reward contributors directly from app revenues without token inflation.
Core Components
Contributors (Miners)
Individuals providing computing resources via devices such as mobile phones, PCs, or dedicated servers.
DePIN Coordinator
A data encryption, decryption and smart contract system managing miner rewards, resource allocation, and task distribution.
DeHub Application
The streaming and gaming app interfacing with the DePIN to request and deliver data.
Clients (End Users)
Users consuming content via DeHub.
Workflow
Resource Sharing: Contributors register and allocate resources.
Task Assignment: The DePIN Coordinator assigns tasks such as hosting, transcoding, or delivery based on contributor capacity.
Revenue Sharing: Miners are compensated from a revenue pool funded by in-app revenue and token transaction fees.
Verification: Proof-of-computation mechanisms validate miners' contributions.
Incentive Model
Revenue Pool
The reward pool is composed of:
In-App Revenue: A percentage of subscription fees, ad revenue, and in-app purchases.
Token Transaction Fees: A share of transaction fees from the $DHB token.
Distribution Mechanism
Rewards are distributed based on the volume and quality of contributions.
Miners earn proportionally higher rewards for tasks requiring more resources or bandwidth.

Full System Code Implementation
Miner Client Code
import requests
import time
import hashlib

API_BASE = "https://depin-coordinator.dehub.net"

class MinerClient:
    def __init__(self, device_id, cpu_cores, ram_gb, bandwidth_mbps):
        self.device_id = device_id
        self.cpu_cores = cpu_cores
        self.ram_gb = ram_gb
        self.bandwidth_mbps = bandwidth_mbps
        self.session_token = None

    def register_device(self):
        payload = {
            "device_id": self.device_id,
            "cpu_cores": self.cpu_cores,
            "ram_gb": self.ram_gb,
            "bandwidth_mbps": self.bandwidth_mbps
        }
        response = requests.post(f"{API_BASE}/register", json=payload)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.session_token = response.json().get("session_token")
            print("Registered successfully.")
        else:
            print("Registration failed:", response.text)
Reward Calculator
The DePIN includes a reward calculator that estimates miners' earnings based on their contributions.
Reward = (Task Weight × Resource Score × Revenue Pool Share)
Scalability and Security
Dynamic Task Allocation
Tasks are distributed based on:
Current demand
Contributor capacity
Proximity to end users
Proof-of-Computation
A lightweight proof-of-computation mechanism ensures tasks are completed reliably. Rewards are only issued upon verification.
Conclusion
The proposed DePIN enables truly decentralised, censorship resistant, limitlessly scalable, and cost-efficient infrastructure for DeHub. By leveraging shared computing power and rewarding miners directly from revenue, the system avoids inflation and ensures long-term sustainability.
This model empowers anyone with spare computing resources, from mobile phones to servers, to participate in and benefit from DeHub's growth. In order to disrupt this behemoth of an industry, one requires billionaire backing or true innovation, just like this DePIN.

Advertising
Taking digital advertising to new horizons.
POVR: Proof of View & Rank
Our ad-tech solution is unlike anything else seen across legacy or blockchain markets, and serves a unique purpose within our own app.
"Proof of View" is one dimensional and beyond identification, adds little benefit for users or holders.
What if you could prove viewers were real without wasting block space or gas? What if you could leverage each wallet's financial data, not just for saving costs, but also to maximise ROI for your campaigns? Don't just save more money, make more too!
Our software, with patents pending, does this via an unprecedented 13-tier ranking system combined with our verification badges, which were highlighted in this previous feature spotlight.
We are calling it "proof-of-view-and-rank" or "POVR".
How it works
The higher your total holdings, the higher-ranking badge you unlock, the more you earn from ads, the more companies pay to advertise to you.
This way benefits the whole ecosystem and not just a single party. Content creators, consumers, holders & companies advertising on the platform all reap more rewards.
Financial data is the most lucrative, and ours is uniquely combined into one system advertisers can use to target audiences. This isn't even something you can do off-chain, as bank statements are private whereas the blockchain is public.
Being able to target whales and big spenders while also tailoring special deals or discounts for smaller fish in the sea will re-shape how advertising works across the globe. Why wouldn't anyone want this?
How does this prevent fraud?
Botting becomes less profitable while activity is trackable on-chain, easily connecting bad actors & eventually curating the entire user base. Advertisers target higher ranks, leaving minimal extractable value at the bottom layer, where any remaining fraud remains. On top of that, our decentralised moderation allows more efficient illicit activity detection and prevention.
For more information on our ad revenue sharing, refer to this thread and our whitepaper below. Also, be sure to follow us for all the latest news on app features and updates.

#### 1.1. What is DeHub?

DeHub is a decentralized, user-owned social and streaming platform designed as an alternative to legacy media applications like YouTube, X (Twitter), Twitch, and Patreon. Its core mission is to provide a censorship-resistant ecosystem where creators own their audience data, control their content distribution, and monetize their work without fear of demonetization or corporate gatekeeping.

Built by a team of gamers and streamers, DeHub aims to solve crypto's complexity by offering a seamless Web2 user experience on a fully on-chain backend. Users can sign up with social accounts or email, automatically generating a wallet without needing to manage private keys or gas fees. The platform enables creators to launch Pay-Per-View (PPV) events, offer subscriptions, send paid messages, create "Watch2Earn" experiences, and distribute token-gated content, all transacted with cryptocurrency.

#### 1.2. Core Principles

*   **Censorship Resistance:** Content moderation is handled by a decentralized community governance model, not a central authority.
*   **Creator Ownership:** Creators retain full ownership of their content and audience data, which they can export at any time.
*   **Permissionless Monetization:** Anyone can monetize their content through various on-chain tools without requiring approval.
*   **Transparency:** All transactions and platform revenues are verifiable on the blockchain, with public leaderboards tracking earnings and engagement.

#### 1.3. Important Legal Disclaimer

All information provided is for general, educational, and transparency purposes only and does not constitute financial or investment advice. Digital asset markets are highly volatile and carry inherent risks, including the potential loss of your entire investment due to market fluctuations, technical errors, or security breaches.

### 2. The DeHub Ecosystem: Core dApps & Features

#### 2.1. The DeHub Application (dehub.io)

The central hub of the ecosystem is a social streaming dApp that integrates video content, gaming, and a marketplace. It features a user-friendly interface that abstracts away blockchain complexities, allowing for easy onboarding via social logins or email, which automatically generates a non-custodial wallet for the user.

#### 2.2. Content & Streaming Features

Creators can upload video content and enable various monetization and engagement features with a few clicks:
*   **Watch2Earn:** Attach a token bounty to content to reward viewers and grow an audience.
*   **Token-Gated Content:** Lock content behind a requirement for viewers to hold a specific token (any EVM-compatible token).
*   **Pay-Per-View (PPV):** Charge a one-time fee in any supported token for access to exclusive content or live streams.
*   **NFT Collectibles:** Every post automatically mints an ERC-1155 NFT that earns a lifetime share of the ad revenue generated by that content.
*   **Tipping:** Users can tip creators directly during streams or on video uploads.

#### 2.3. Tokenized Content & Fractionalized Ownership

DeHub introduces a revolutionary content economy where every upload or livestream automatically mints an ERC-1155 NFT, which is then fractionalized into 1,000 pieces.

*   **Creator Control:** Creators initially own all 1,000 fractions. They can choose to sell them to their community for immediate income, hold them to earn ad revenue, or give them away as rewards.
*   **Fan Investment:** Fans can purchase these fractions, becoming stakeholders in the content's success. They earn a proportional share of all revenue (ads, tips, etc.) generated by that piece of content for its entire lifetime.
*   **Passive, Eternal Revenue:** Unlike other SocialFi platforms that require continuous creator activity to maintain token value, DeHub's model generates residual income for life from a single piece of content.

| Platform | Content Model | Value Creation Requirement | Revenue Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DeHub** | ERC-1155 fractionalised into 1,000 pieces per upload | **NONE** - Residual income for life | Eternal ad revenue + tips + PPV |
| Friend.tech | Social keys for access to creator chats | Continuous engagement required | Key trading fees |
| Lens Protocol | NFT-based social graph | Active posting and community building | Creator retains all content revenue |
| Zora | Hyper-speculative social tokens | Constant hype and speculation | Token trading, minting fees |
| Patreon | Subscription tiers | Regular content delivery | Creator keeps 90-95% |

#### 2.4. Live Streaming

The platform offers a robust livestreaming service powered by **Livepeer**, a decentralized video infrastructure network.
*   **Scalability:** The infrastructure is built to support over 50,000 concurrent viewers initially, with the ability to scale further.
*   **Interactive Tipping:** Tips sent during a stream trigger real-time animated effects on-screen, with different animations for different tip amounts, creating a gamified and engaging experience.
*   **Accessibility:** A text-to-voice feature can read chat messages aloud, allowing creators to engage with their audience without constantly monitoring the chat.
*   **Integration:** Supports direct browser-based streaming or external software like OBS and Streamlabs via custom stream keys.

#### 2.5. On-Chain Subscriptions

DeHub is the first protocol to deploy fully on-chain, tradable subscriptions.
*   **NFT-Based Access:** When a user subscribes to a creator, a unique NFT is minted to their wallet. This NFT serves as their access key to exclusive content and private group chats.
*   **Tradable Assets:** Since the subscription is an NFT, it can be sold or traded on any secondary NFT marketplace. This allows early supporters to potentially profit if a creator's popularity grows.
*   **Creator Control:** Creators can define multiple subscription tiers (e.g., 1-month, 3-month, annual, lifetime) with different prices and perks. They also earn a royalty on every secondary sale of their subscription NFTs.

#### 2.6. Messaging System

DeHub provides a secure, private, and monetizable messaging system.
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** All direct and group messages are encrypted, ensuring privacy.
*   **Paid DMs:** Users can pay a fee to send a "Priority Message," which appears at the top of a creator's inbox, guaranteeing attention.
*   **Paywalled Media:** Creators can send photos and videos in messages that are locked behind a paywall, which recipients can pay to unlock.
*   **Group Chats:** Creators can establish token-gated or subscription-tier-based group chats for their communities.

#### 2.7. Gaming Arcade & Last Chad Standing (LCS)

As a team of gamers, DeHub has developed a gaming vertical.
*   **Arcade:** A suite of free-to-play, casual arcade games with a play-and-earn model sustained by platform fee generation.
*   **Last Chad Standing (LCS):** The flagship game in development. It is a hyper-realistic, MMA-inspired Battle Royale game. The development involves talent from major studios like Ubisoft and leverages the team's connections with UFC stars.

### 3. Technology & Infrastructure

#### 3.1. DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)

To ensure true censorship resistance and scalability, DeHub is building its own DePIN.
*   **Shared Computing:** Users (miners) can contribute computing resources from their devices (mobile phones, PCs, servers) for data hosting, transcoding, and delivery.
*   **Incentive Model:** Miners are rewarded directly from a pool funded by application revenue (e.g., ad revenue, platform fees) and a share of $DHB transaction fees. This creates a sustainable, non-inflationary model.
*   **Goal:** To create a user-owned, limitlessly scalable, and cost-efficient infrastructure that ensures the platform lives forever on-chain.

#### 3.2. AI Toolkits

DeHub is integrating a suite of AI-powered tools to assist creators and users.
*   **Content Creation:** AI assistance for writing, editing, and optimizing posts.
*   **Automated Engagement:** Automate social interactions and tipping based on user-defined criteria.
*   **Finance Management:** AI aid for tracking earnings, managing tips, and optimizing monetization strategies.
*   **Performance Analytics:** Tools to analyze trends and understand audience behavior.

#### 3.3. Content Moderation & Governance

DeHub employs a decentralized moderation system to avoid centralized censorship.
*   **Moderation Mining:** Top-tier badge holders and stakers can vote to remove content that violates community-approved guidelines. Correctly voting on content moderation issues is rewarded.
*   **Economic Disincentives:** Malicious actors are disincentivized as botting becomes unprofitable and bad behavior is trackable on-chain.
*   **Quadratic Voting:** To prevent whale dominance in key decisions, voting power is calculated as the square root of tokens staked, giving smaller holders a more proportional voice.
*   **DAO Appeals:** Creators can appeal moderation decisions through a formal DAO proposal and vote.

### 4. $DHB Token & Platform Economy

#### 4.1. Core Utility & Superpowers

The $DHB token is the central utility token of the ecosystem. Its uses include:
*   **Transactions:** Tipping, paying for subscriptions, and unlocking PPV content.
*   **Staking:** Staking $DHB provides rewards and access to certain platform features.
*   **Governance:** Participating in community voting and moderation.
*   **Fee Reduction:** Holding $DHB reduces platform fees.
*   **Superpowers:** Users can pay in $DHB to activate platform "hacks" to boost engagement, such as "Trend Jacker" (get a topic on the trending list) or "Harpoon" (target ads to specific badge holders).

#### 4.2. Badge of Honour System

Users are rewarded with cosmetic badges and enhanced features based on their $DHB holdings. This system is integral to both platform gamification and the advertising model.

| Badge Tier | Holdings Required ($DHB) |
| :--- | :--- |
| No Badge | < 10,000 |
| Crab Badge | 10,000+ |
| Lobster Badge | 25,000+ |
| Piranha Badge | 50,000+ |
| Tortoise Badge | 100,000+ |
| Cobra Badge | 250,000+ |
| Octopus Badge | 500,000+ |
| Crocodile Badge | 1,000,000+ |
| Dolphin Badge | 2,000,000+ |
| Tiger Shark Badge | 3,000,000+ |
| Killer Whale Badge | 5,000,000+ |
| Great White Shark Badge | 10,000,000+ |
| Blue Whale Badge | 25,000,000+ |
| Megalodon Badge | 50,000,000+ |

#### 4.3. Platform Fee Structure

DeHub's fee structure rewards token holders. The standard platform fee on transactions like tips and subscriptions is 10%. However, this fee is reduced by 0.69% for each badge tier a user achieves, down to a minimum of 1% for Megalodon badge holders.

| Badge Tier | Platform Fee |
| :--- | :--- |
| No Badge | 10.00% |
| Crab Badge | 9.31% |
| Lobster Badge | 8.62% |
| ... | ... |
| Megalodon Badge | 1.00% |

#### 4.4. Advertising (POVR: Proof of View & Rank)

DeHub features a unique, patent-pending ad-tech solution called POVR.
*   **Concept:** Advertisers can target users based on their on-chain financial data, as represented by their Badge Tier. This allows for precise targeting of high-value audiences ("whales") or specific segments.
*   **Benefits:** This benefits the entire ecosystem. Users with higher holdings earn more from ads, creators receive a share, and advertisers achieve a higher ROI by reaching verified, valuable audiences. It also helps prevent ad fraud, as botting lower tiers is unprofitable.
*   **Pricing:** The Cost Per Mille (CPM) rate is tiered based on the user's badge, starting at $2.50 for "No Badge" users and increasing linearly to $35.00 for "Megalodon" holders.

| Badge Tier | Holdings Required | CPM Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| No Badge | < 10,000 $DHB | $2.50 |
| Crab Badge | 10,000+ $DHB | $5.00 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Megalodon Badge | 50,000,000+ $DHB | $35.00 |

### 5. Ecosystem Projects

#### 5.1. Fan.site Fork

In a strategic move to keep the main DeHub platform focused and inclusive, a separate, connected entity called **Fan.site** was created by forking the DeHub application.
*   **Purpose:** To target the adult entertainment market, an industry ripe for disruption by blockchain due to issues with payment processors, high fees, and censorship.
*   **Separation:** This strategic separation allows each platform to tailor its user experience and community guidelines to its specific audience without compromise.
*   **Economic Symbiosis:** A crucial component of the fork is that **10% of all revenue generated by Fan.site is used to buy back $DHB tokens on the open market and distribute them to DeHub stakers.** This creates constant buy pressure for $DHB and rewards loyal community members, directly tying the success of the fork to the health of the core DeHub ecosystem.
*   **Funding:** Fan.site successfully completed a $1,000,000 funding round to secure a multi-year runway for marketing and development.

### 6. The DeHub Team

DeHub was founded by a team with diverse expertise in Web3 development, social media, gaming, and business.

*   **Malik Jan (Co-Founder):** Founder of DeLabs LTD and co-founder of Puso Group. Experience in fundraising (Guide Dogs), senior consulting (Randstad), and regional management (ITS Construction).
*   **Mike Hales (Co-Founder):** Founder of MMA brand Rapz and joint-owner of First Class, the UK's largest TikTok partner agency with nearly 1000 streamers. A successful streamer and digital artist.
*   **Indi Jay Cammish (Co-Founder):** Social media and content expert with experience working on world tours with global music stars (Mabel) and co-founder of the First Class TikTok agency.
*   **Bailey Young (Co-Founder):** Operations lead, tokenomics expert, and former professional gamer (ranked top 3 globally in COD MW2). Oversaw the $1M fundraise for Blocjerk (now Fan.site).

### 7. Project History & Key Milestones

*   **V1 Contract Security Incident (2021):** An early vulnerability was found in the V1 smart contract. The team acted transparently, paused the contract, and airdropped tokens 1:1 to all holders in a new, secure contract.
*   **Gate.io Delisting (2023):** DeHub voluntarily delisted from the Gate.io exchange to protect its liquidity pool from bots and align with its core values of decentralization, especially after Gate.io ended UK support. All remaining tokens on the exchange were burned.
*   **Strategic Pivot to Layer 2s:** Following the guidance of Ethereum thought leaders like Vitalik Buterin, DeHub has shifted its primary focus from Ethereum L1 to Layer 2 solutions, primarily **Coinbase's Base network**, to ensure low fees, high transaction speeds, and a better user experience for its consumer-facing application. Support for Ethereum Mainnet is being discontinued.

### 8. Security & Legal

#### 8.1. Security Measures

*   **Audits:** The platform's contracts have been audited by third-party firms like **Certik**.
*   **Bug Bounty:** DeHub runs a bug bounty program, encouraging security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   **Decentralization:** The core infrastructure is designed to be decentralized, reducing single points of failure.
